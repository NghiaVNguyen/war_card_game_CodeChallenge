Hello NWEA,

Thank you for providing me an opportunity to complete the War Card Game code challenge. I have included the zip file with all source files for review. To many understanding, I am attempting to fill the Front-End Developer position. Therefore I decided to complete this challenge in JavaScript/Angular to demonstrate my abilities in front-end development. Thus, in order to properly run the code challenge, you will need to start the server.js file with node or nodemon. After that, you will be able to see in your browser, the War game. 

I hope my code is up to your expectations and I look forward to hearing more from you.

Kind regards,
Nghia Nguyen



INSTRUCTIONS:

	In your command terminal, locate the file directory and use node or nodemon (or similar) to run the “server.js” file. Afterwards, launch a web browser and go to “localhost:8000” 

	From there, you can view the demo of the War card game.
